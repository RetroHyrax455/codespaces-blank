<h3> Information, Facts, and Uses of Fruits</h3>

<section class="grape">
<p>Fruits are nature's candy, grown straight from the earthy soil some sprout from trees some sprout from bushes. They come in a variety of different colors, shapes, and sizes as well as ranging in many different tastes from sweet, to sour, and bitter.</p>
<p>Fruits can be fleshy or dry, fleshy fruits are juicy and soft. For example, blueberry, strawberries, and razzberries. While dry fruits consist of raizins, almonds, walnuts</p>
<p> Fruits are good for you, they contain nutritions like vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibers. </p>
<p> Fruts are commonly eaten plainly, though, there are many ways fruits can be used such as being used in smoothies, milkshakes, baking, jellies, desserts, and savory dishes.  </p>
